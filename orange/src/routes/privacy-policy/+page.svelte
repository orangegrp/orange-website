        <p>Last updated: {lastUpdated}</p> 
        <p>orangeðŸŸ  by 332 ("us", "we", or "our") operates Internet services (the "Services") as follows:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>orangeðŸŸ  "Discord" Bot (the "Bot")</li>
            <li>orangeðŸŸ  Code Runner Service (the "CRS", "orangeðŸŸ  CRS")</li>
            <li>orangeðŸŸ  Dash (the "Dash", "dashboard", "control panel", "admin panel")</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            We may collect information about you, your device and your use of the Services. The type of information collected and the purposes
            for which we collect it may differ between Services.
        </p> 

        <h3>When you use the Bot, we may collect and store the following data:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Discord account user identifiers and public metadata (including avatar URIs, usernames, nicknames, display names, etc)</li>
            <li>Discord guild identifiers including public (and in some cases private) guild metadata (including guild name, guild icon URIs, banner image URIs, guild events, audit logs, etc)</li>
            <li>Discord text channel data (including messages, reactions, mentions, attachments, embeds, other message components, etc)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When you use the CRS exclusively, we may collect and store the following data:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) Address and related port numbers</li>
            <li>Device information and metadata (operating system, browser type, browser version, etc)</li>
            <li>Inferred geolocation data (based on IP addresses and device metadata)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Note, in some cases, when using the CRS, for instance when using it through the Bot, none of the above data may be collected about you.
            Instead, the collected data would relate to the running Bot instance offering the CRS through the Discord platform.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p> 
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">

            <li>Improving the Services</li>
            <li>Monitoring the usage of the Services for research and development purposes</li>
            <li>Detecting and preventing abuse of the Services</li>
            <li>Protecting our infrastructure and Services from cyber security threats</li>
            <li>Responding to cyber security threats</li>
            <li>Regulatory compliance and law enforcement purposes</li>
